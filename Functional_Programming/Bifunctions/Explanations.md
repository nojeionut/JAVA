# BiFunction in Java

`BiFunction` is a functional interface in Java that represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result. This is a specialization of `Function` for the case where two inputs are required.

The `BiFunction` interface defines an abstract method named `apply()` that takes two arguments and returns a result.

Here is the method signature:

```java
R apply(T t, U u);
```

Where `T` and `U` are the types of the input arguments, and `R` is the type of the result.

## Example

Here is a simple example of a `BiFunction` that takes two `Integer` values and returns their sum:

```java
BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> adder = (a, b) -> a + b;
Integer result = adder.apply(2, 3);
System.out.println(result);  // Output: 5
```

In this example, `adder` is a `BiFunction` that adds two `Integer` values together. The `apply()` method is used to apply the `BiFunction` to the arguments `2` and `3`, and the result is printed to the console.

## Chaining BiFunctions

`BiFunction` interface also has default methods like `andThen()` which can be used to chain multiple functions together.

Here is an example:

```java
BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> adder = (a, b) -> a + b;
Function<Integer, Integer> doubler = a -> a * 2;

BiFunction<Integer, Integer, Integer> addThenDouble = adder.andThen(doubler);

Integer result = addThenDouble.apply(2, 3);
System.out.println(result);  // Output: 10
```

In this example, `addThenDouble` is a `BiFunction` that first adds two `Integer` values together using `adder`, then doubles the result using `doubler`. The `apply()` method is used to apply the `BiFunction` to the arguments `2` and `3`, and the result is printed to the console.
```
