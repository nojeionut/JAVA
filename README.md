## Consumer

A Consumer is a functional interface that accepts a single input and performs an operation without returning a result.

## BiConsumer

A BiConsumer is a functional interface that accepts two inputs and performs an operation without returning a result.

## Function

A Function is a functional interface that accepts one input and produces a result.

## BiFunction

A BiFunction is a functional interface that accepts two inputs and produces a result.

## Predicate

A Predicate is a functional interface that accepts one input and returns a boolean value. It is often used to test conditions and filter data.

## BiPredicate

A BiPredicate is a functional interface that accepts two inputs and returns a boolean value. It is often used to test conditions involving two inputs.

## Supplier

A Supplier is a functional interface that produces a result of a given generic type. It takes no input.
